- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html): Install Terraform according to the instructions provided in the official documentation.
- please enter your github token in terraform.tfvars file

## Getting Started

To get started with using the Terraform configuration files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-repo.git
   ```

2. Change into the repository directory:

   ```

3. Initialize the Terraform working directory by running the following command:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

   This will download the necessary provider plugins and set up the working directory.

4. Customize the configuration files according to your specific requirements. The variables.tf file contains the input variables that can be modified to adjust the configuration.

5. Plan and review the changes that Terraform will make by running the following command:

   terraform apply
   ```

   Terraform will now provision the specified infrastructure resources.

7. (Optional) If you no longer need the infrastructure resources created by Terraform, you can destroy them by running the following command:
